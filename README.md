| Feature Details / Additional Features | 
| --- |
|Brake indicator / toggle. Brake is now a toggle and is on by default when entering the seat. There is an onscreen text indicator to show you when the brake is on. The brake can be set to work like default with an Edit LUA Parameter setting.|
|Interplanetary Helper - Use __Alt-1__ and __Alt-2__ or __SHIFT-R__ / __SHIFT-T__ to cycle through target planets (incl. option SatNav locations). Shows distance, travel time (including acceleration, travel and braking - absolute total), brake time (current and max). Note that currently, Brake Time is inaccurate if you're inside atmosphere. Once you're in space, it will properly read the space brakes and give the correct values. Shows max mass for your ship on planet at sea level based on brakes. Note: If going to a planet with atmosphere, you must get the max mass reading while in atmosphere, and same if going to planet with no atmosphere.|
|Activate Gyyro - Use __Alt-9__ to toggle your placed gyro on and off. When a gyro is on, the ship's perceived orientation shifts to the gyro's orientation vice the core's orientation. So if you mount the gyro facing up, up becomes forward if the gyro is on (orientation of gyro is important, which determines which axis are pointing where).|
|Dodgin's Don't Die Rocket Governor - Set your speed with cruise control and press __B__ to have your rocket engines fire up to that speed and no faster|
|Auto-Land on Gear Down - Putting down your landing gear sets your hover height to 0, raising it sets it to max. Entering a vehicle with gear down sets the height to 0, entering a vehicle with the gear up sets it to max|
|Door/Ramp Automation - Automatically closes doors/ramps when entering and opens them when exiting. Requires you to link these to the seat once, and it will remember and relink them each time you configure it afterward. No renaming required.|
|(ButtonHUD) Buttons and custom controls - Custom implementations of virtual joystick and mouse controls, allowing you to use virtual joystick without that disgusting giant circle on your screen. Buttons to use many of the features. Buttons page appears when keeping __SHIFT__ pressed (not in freelook mode).|
|Atmospheric Package - Auto-Takeoff, Auto-Land, Altitude Hold and Follow Mode for Remote Controllers|
|Fuel Tanks - These are no longer automatically slotted to seat. You still get fuel readouts under the minimap. If you want the standard fuel widget, you will need to link the fuel tank(s) to the seat one time and then run the autoconfig. Autoconfig also needs to be run whenever the number of tanks changes in the construct.|
|AutoPilot - Use __Alt-4__ when you have a target selected with the Interplanetary Helper, and you are in space with clear line of sight to the target. The script will align to the optimal vector to place you in a 1 SU orbit from the target, accelerate, cut engines when appropriate, and brake until orbit is achieved.|
|Glide Re-Entry - Recommended before activate: align ship prograde and slow down to 2000km/hr and be within 20km. Once activated: ship will angle down to -30 degrees and accelerate(slow) to Re-Entry speed (1050km/hr default). Once the ship reaches Re-Entry Altitude (default: 2500m) it will attempt to level off into altitude hold at that height. If glide re-entry is done as part of a saved location autopilot, the ship will then begin alignment and navigation to saved waypoint.|
|Parachute Re-Entry - Recommend before activate: be within 20-30km of planet. Be at a stop or less than 3000km/hr. Once activated:  Ship will angle down to -80 degrees and accelerate to 1050km/hr (re-entry speed). When atmosphere reaches 0.02, brake landing will activate.|
|Trip odometers and information display.|
|Fuel level displays for all types of fuel tanks. Ability to unslot fuel tanks to save slots.|
|Altitude hold, pitch hold, auto-landing and takeoff functionality.|
|Orbital alignment and maneuver assistants and orbital information widget which shows apoapsis, periapsis, apogee, perigee, eccentricity for the nearest planet, using these libraries: https://gitlab.com/JayleBreak/dualuniverse/-/tree/master/DUflightfiles/autoconf/custom |
|Radar and periscope for situational awareness (only shown when applicable).|
|Ability to hide the built-in display windows to keep your flight aesthetic clean and focused.|
|Free-look mode (__ALT__ as toggle).|
|User Parameters for customization of your HUD elements (e.g. x/y screen position) and your flight preference to your ship capabilities.|
|Save parameters between HUD version updates (requires linking of a databank!).|
|Manual Control HotKey|Pressing Stop engines (__Z__ by default) 2x within 1 second will clear ALL AP / special functions. You will be at 0 engine in throttle mode with brakes off. (normal __Z__ behavior) but all special features like altitude hold or brake landing or anything else will turn off. (Give me manual control key) Pressing it just once is normal vanilla stop all engines. NOTE: This will NOT turn off antigrav or stop a warp in progress.|
|Ability to change HUD colors (RGB in PrimaryR, PrimaryG, PrimaryB)|
|Stall Warning if your alignment drops below configured StallAngle (35 by default) - EVERY SHIP WILL BE DIFFERENT!|

<!--Warnings and disclaimers-->
# Warnings

##### DISCLAIMER: We do not accept any responsibility for incorrect use of the autopilot, which may result in fiery reentry, mountain impacts or undesired entrance into PvP. Read and heed the warnings below!

##### :warning: Auto-Land - Use with supervision. Will only engage if brakes > total mass. Uses brakes and hovers / vertical engines to lower you to a safe landing.
##### :warning: Autopilot (Space) - Not suitable for interplanetay trips less than 2SU. Ensure you have LOS (line of sight) to the target body before engaging as autopilot is direct flight and does not detect bodies (will fly into a planet / body if in between starting position and destination).
##### :warning: Autopilot to Saved Location - Accurate within roughly 15m of saved and selected location assuming a brake landing is available. If Coast Landing is displayed, you will need to resume control upon arrival at your destination.
##### :warning: Auto-Rentry - Not suitable for bodies without atmosphere. Not suitable for bodies with high altitudes (Thades etc.). Know the altitude of the surface before using! __Alt-Space__ and/or __Alt-C__ may be used to adjust hover altitude as needed.

<!--Basic install instructions / point them towards real install instructions-->
# Installation

|This section is broken down into three parts.|
| --- |
|1) Pre-installation notes.|
|2) Instructions to locate the release (which also contains install instructions).|
|3) Post-installation notes.|
|Please read this section in its entirety before proceeding with the installation.|

##### 1) Pre-installation Notes:

##### :black_small_square: Button - If manually connected to the seat, will be pressed when you enter (sit), and open / extend when you exit (stand).
##### :black_small_square: Databank - Although not required, we recommend a databank to be used. This allows the HUD to save your user preferences and some long-term variables.  In addition, flight status is saved if you leave and return to the seat.
##### :black_small_square: Doors / Forcefields - If manually connected to the seat, will close / retract when you enter (sit), and open / extend when you exit (stand). Ensure they are closed / retracted before connecting to the seat.
##### :black_small_square: Fuel tanks - If _not_ manually connected provide a rough estimate of fuel levels (set parameters for fuel tank handling talent). If manually connected, more accurate readings are provided and a non-HUD widget is updated.

## 2) On the right side of this page, locate and click on "Releases" or select the "Release" listed as the latest. Detailed changelog and installation instructions are located there.

##### 3) Post-installation Note:
##### :black_small_square: This HUD uses on-screen buttons, and so needs to be able to use your mouse. The only way to keep DU from trying to use your mouse for input is to set the Control Scheme to Keyboard. You can then right click the seat, Advanced -> Edit LUA Parameters and find the checkboxes to choose which control scheme you would actually like to use.

# Usage
#### The HUD makes use of on-screen buttons and keyboard controls. An overview followed by more detailed descriptions are below:

| Item | Key(s) | Brief Description|
| --- | --- | --- |
|UI Overlay|Hold __SHIFT__|Displays the UI overlay with mouse-over buttons. Hover with mouse over a button (not click!) and let go of SHIFT to select it.|
|Save Location|Hold __SHIFT__ then selecting the __Save Position__ mouseover| Will save the current location in the databank (if installed). This location may be selected by the autopilot option to automatically fly to the destination.  It will _not_ monitor for impeeding structures or ships. Monitor during use. Locations will be named by planet/moon and a number.|
|Update Location|Hold __SHIFT__ then selecting the __Update Position__ mouseover| Select a previously saved location in the Interplanetary Helper to change its name with the name of the closest atmo radar target name. This is a workaround until manual editing/naming of locations is available.|
|Free Look|__ALT__|Toggles free-look mode (mouse moves camera around ship, not flight input). Please note that your view does not auto center when exiting Free Look. Free Look must be enabled to zoom in 3rd person mode.|
|Autopilot Destination / Destination Select|__Option 1__ and __Option 2__, <br/>__ALT-1__ and __ALT-2__ or <br/>__SHIFT-R__ and __SHIFT-T__)|Cycles through autopilot destinations (planets / bodies / saved waypoints).|
|Toggle HUD|__Option 3__, or __ALT-3__|Toggles the primary hud display HUD on/off, i.e. if off the vanilla widgets will appear.|
|Autopilot|__Option 4__, or __ALT-4__|Ship will tilt up at preset max angle (30 by default) and fly to 50km altitude and then engage autopilot to selected planet/moon. Once it arrives it will establish orbit and align to prograde. If a saved location was chosen, it will glide entry in and then autopilot to location. NOTE: It does not check to see if anything is in front of you on ground (like normal) nor if your target planet is behind current planet even 50km in space. DO NOT USE if your ship cannot power out of atmosphere at 30 deg with 100% engines. USE WITH CAUTION FIRST TIME. Tested Alioth to Sanct and Sanct to Alioth repeatedly.|
|Lock Pitch|__Option 5__, or __ALT-5__|Will lock your target pitch at current pitch and attempt to maintain that pitch (this is different from Altitude Hold) Most other AP features will cancel Lock Pitch.
|Altitude Hold|__Option 6__, or __ALT-6__|Toggles the altitude hold functionality. Tries to keep the current altitude in spite of planetary curvatore. Depending on ship's lift/force, the actual height may be less than the targeted height! Adjust altitude with (left) __ALT-C__ (down) and (left) __ALT-SPACE__ (up) in increments (growing increments if key is kept held down).|
|Save / Clear Databank Settings|__Option 7__, or __ALT-7__|Save or clear (double tap!) the currently saved configuration settings.|
|Follow Me|__Option 8__, or __ALT-8__|Engage follow mode if you are using Remote Control.|
|Anti-Gravity Generator|__ALT-G__ (default mapping) or <br/>HUD button|Once engaged, hold __ALT-C__ to lower target height or __ALT-Space__ to raise target height. The AGG's actual height will only change at 4m/s up or down toward the target altitude. Initiate new target altitude before leaving seat and AGG will continue changing.|
<!--Messy Messy details. This needs to be cleaned up.-->
| Item | Detailed Description|
| --- | --- |
|UI Overlay|Hold __SHIFT__ to show the UI overlay with buttons (not in freelook!). Mouse over a button and let go of __SHIFT__ to select it (not clicking it). While holding SHIFT, press R/T (speedup/speeddown) to cycle between autopilot targets.|
|Free Look|__ALT__ is now a toggle for free-look. Because of the way we had to use Keyboard mode, it can't re-center when you lock it back, but that can be desirable in some situations|
|Autopilot Destination / Destination Select|__ALT-1__ and __ALT-2__ (__Option1__ and __Option2__) to scroll between target planets for Autopilot and display. This also works using SHIFT-R and SHIFT-T to scroll. This widget will not display if no planet is selected (ie you must press one of these hotkeys after entering the seat in order to show the widget)|
|HUD Toggle|__ALT-3__ toggles the HUD and other widgets off/on. Orbital display and autopilot information will still show if HUD is off. There is a parameter you can set to have HUD and Widgets on at same time.|
|Autopilot|__ALT-4__ to engage Autopilot for interplanetary travel, if you are in space and have a planet targeted. Ensure you have a clear line of sight to the target. This will align to the target, realign slightly to point 200km to the side of the target, accelerate, cut engines when at max, start braking when appropriate, and hopefully achieve a stable orbit around the target. You can set your target orbit distance in parameters, default is 100km. Recommend do not go less then 35km.
|Lock Pitch|__ALT-5__ (__Option 5__) will lock your pitch at current pitch and attempt to maintain that pitch (this is different from Altitude Hold) Most other AP features will cancel Lock Pitch.|
|Altitude Hold - |__ALT-6__ to toggle Altitude Hold. If used while flying (with gear up), this will attempt to hold at the altitude you turned it on at and put you in cruise control at current speed. You can modify target height with LALT+C (down) and LALT+spacebar (up). Cruise speed is modified like normal. Hitting ALT-6 again or tapping brake will stop Alt-Hold mode but leave you in cruise control. ALT-6 while landed (with gear down) to turn on Auto Takeoff - this is simply Altitude Hold that sets you to a paramater-defined distance above your starting position (default 1km). You must control your own thrust and release the brake to takeoff. G (Gear) is a very loaded key. While in atmosphere it will attempt to Brake Land if your brakes are strong enough (stop you and float to ground). If not it will attempt to coast land (angle down till slow enough and within hover/vbooster height then land). If in space it will initiate re-entry to a specific altitude (2500m by default) at a specific re-entry speed (1050km/hr default). You may modify the target values via Edit LUA Parameters, or use Alt-C and Alt-Spacebar to lower and raise target height, and mousewheel to change target cruise speed.|MaxPitch affects all of the below, autotake off, landing, and re-entry. Default value is 20 degrees.
|Save/Clear Variables in Databank|__ALT-7__ to Wipe variables in a databank, you must press it a second time to confirm - Hitting __ALT-7__ 2x will wipe all data except saved locations from databank. To wipe saved locations you must select them as a target and then use Clear button shown while holding shift. Or you can pick up the databank, remove dynamic properties, and then put it back down, this clears everything from it.|
|Follow Mode|__ALT-8__ will toggle Follow Mode when using a Remote Controller. This makes your craft lift off and try to follow you wherever you go. It will not go below ground unless you dig out a big enough hole that it would naturally go down while hovering.|
|Toggle Gyro|__ALT-9__ to toggle a linked gyro on or off. If a gyro is installed on your ship, this will change your ships perceived orientation from Core to Gyro. This is used to allow you to control flight based on gyro orientation and not core orientation.|
|Radar|Radar indicates below minimap number of targets or if it is jammed (atmosphere in space or space in atmosphere). The radar widget only pops up if targets are detected. The periscope widget only pops up if you click a target and successfully identify it. All widgets close automagically.|

## Smart Switches
This script will have automatic behaviors for certain switches depending on the name you give it. Any name used not in this description will be just be toggled. 

Name your element switches to the following to get specific behavior: 
* **navBlinkSwitch** = Blinking NAV Anti Collision lights (Usually the top/bottom red lights on an aircraft). 
* **navLightSwitch** = Turns on NAV Directional lights (Usually green on the left, and red on the right, and three white lights in the rear on an aircraft). 
* **headLightSwitch** = Turns on and off Headlights according to ground height (Use *HeadlightGroundHeight* to set desired height).
* **fuelDisplaySwitch** = Turns on programming board that contains Fuel Display script attached to screen.

<!--This should go somewhere else, I'm not sure where yet.-->
## Variable Persistence
As mentioned briefly above, your custom variables are saved between reloading configurations if you attach a databank to the ship (and use Alt+7 to save them). However, all variables in the program are saved in the databank when you exit the seat. This means it will be exactly as you left it - if you were landed when you got out, it won't jump off the ground when you get it.

This also means that when using autopilot, you can relatively easily move between a seat and Remote Controller; it will be down for a short time while you swap, but everything is saved and it will pick up where it left off.|
